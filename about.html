        <p>
          My name is Emaree, and I’m passionate about music, creativity, and digital design.
          I spend a lot of my time creating audio projects, experimenting with sound,
          and working in the studio.
        </p>

        <p>
          I’ve been making music since I was about nine years old, learning everything 
          alongside my older brother. We started out recording songs on a phone—experimenting, 
          having fun, and teaching ourselves how to create something from nothing. Over the years, 
          that passion only grew. I went from recording on mobile apps to producing full tracks in 
          FL Studio, developing my sound, and taking music seriously. Today, as Daezhuan, I’m releasing 
          music on streaming platforms like Spotify and steadily gaining listeners, now close to 
          1,000 monthly listeners. Music has always been a part of my life, and it continues to 
          motivate everything I create.
